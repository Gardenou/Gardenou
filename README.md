# 👋 Hi, I'm Jordi Garriga

I'm a passionate Computer Engineer and AI enthusiast from Catalonia.  
I truly believe technology only matters when it serves people — especially the most vulnerable.  
My work combines **software engineering**, **AI**, and **social impact**, from developing intelligent systems and backend services to leading digital transformation initiatives in the non-profit sector.

Currently:
- 🎓 Completing a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering (UOC)
- 🤖 Building AI agents, Telegram bots, and ML-powered tools
- 🌱 Always learning, always improving
